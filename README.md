# OnlyResult

An implementation of the Result pattern is typically used within the functional paradigm.

The Result Pattern forces the user to handle failure cases properly and provide errors.
This removes the need to use exceptions for all kinds of flow control and error handling and creates an easy-to-use system to handle errors.

This implementation aims to make it easy for the user to expand it. See [OnlyResult](https://github.com/BatistaCo-Pedro/OnlyResult/blob/master/OnlyResult/README.md)

To create your result class, you can use the `OnlyResult.Abstractions` as a starting point. [OnlyResults.Abstractions](https://github.com/BatistaCo-Pedro/OnlyResult/blob/master/OnlyResult.Abstractions/README.md)
